Hi! I'm Jim, a self-taught fullstack dev from Melbourne, Australia. At any given moment, you might find me working on:

- a svelte library
- a rust app or port
- reggie the reverse game engine
- a new youtube video
- a new article on *dev.to*
- _

I'm always happy to chat about any technologies I use or projects that I'm working on. You can find me in any of the places below; if you have a question or you'd like to help with something I make, come say hi :)
